# Python-Script-Convert-PDF-to-Excel-
To convert a PDF to Excel using Python, you will need to use a third-party library like pdfplumber or PyPDF2. Here is an example of how you can use pdfplumber to extract the text from a PDF and write it to an Excel file:

This code will open the PDF file, extract the text from each page, split the text into lines, and write the lines to an Excel file. You can customize this code to suit your specific needs, such as formatting the data in a particular way or only extracting certain pieces of information from the PDF.

Note that this method may not always produce accurate results, as PDFs are not always structured in a way that is easy to parse. If the PDF has a table or grid structure, you may have better luck using a tool specifically designed for extracting data from tables in PDFs.
