# Python-Script-Convert-PDF-to-Excel-
To convert a PDF file to an Excel spreadsheet in Python, you can use the pandas library. Here's an example of how to do it:

Keep in mind that this method works best if the PDF file has a structured layout, with rows and columns of data. If the PDF file is primarily text or has a more complex layout, the conversion may not be perfect.

You may also need to install additional libraries such as pyPDF2, xlwt, or openpyxl to handle the PDF and Excel files.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
